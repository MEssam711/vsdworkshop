This is the first snapshot of doing the task steps:


But I got these below two errors while installing the iverilog and gtkwave packages:

E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process using it?
